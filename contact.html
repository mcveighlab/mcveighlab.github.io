          <h3>Interested in joining our team?</h3>
          <p>We are always interested to hear from scientists interested in undertaking
            postgraduate or postdoctoral research in our lab. Below is some information on
            working at QUB, and some information on funding opportunities.
            <a href="mailto:paul.mcveigh@qub.ac.uk">Drop us a line</a> if
            you're interested in discussing any of these opportunities. </p>

          <br><h4>Working at QUB</h4>
          <p>Postgraduate research students at QUB are supported by the <a href
            ="https://www.qub.ac.uk/graduate-school/">Graduate School</a>, through which
            training and development opportunities are available to all. Postdoctoral researchers are supported
            by the <a href="https://www.qub.ac.uk/sites/pdc/">Postdoctoral Development Centre</a>, which provides
